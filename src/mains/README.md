# Mains

These are complete meals that one would typically eat for lunch or dinner. They are all comprised of at least one type of legume, whole grain, and vegetable.

Feel free to substitute the fresh ingredients with whatever you may have, especially if they are part of the same [food group](../food_groups.md). For example, in the [Sweet Potato Hash recipe](../mains/sweet_potato_hash.md), you can substitute the one sweet potato for two or three carrots without any other changes to the recipe. Both are root vegetables and, whilst sweet potatoes are the healthier of the two, both have similar nutritional profiles.
