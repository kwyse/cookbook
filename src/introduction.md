Many recipes are simply my preferential alterations on recipes mentioned in these books. I can vouch for each recipe I've included, since I wanted to write them up in a more digestable form that I could continually refer back to. They're tasty, relatively easy to make, but most importantly they are _simple_.

I've come across recipes elsewhere that mention hard-to-find ingredients, use about every kitchen gadget imagineable during preparation, and require cooking part of the dish in a frying pan, another part in a food processor, some in the oven, the grains in a saucepan, _and_ a final condiment in high-speed blender. These recipes are hard enough to understand conceptually, but then they take time to carry out, give ample oportunities for mistakes, and leave no small amount of washing up to do after the fact.

I would prefer to sacrifice some culinary flair for the sake of simple, tasty, good-value, wholesome food. That is the sentiment behind my inclusions and my alterations.
