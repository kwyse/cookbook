# Cookbook

This book comprises of cooking recipes. The recipes are vegan and follow a whole-food, plant-based diet. They are based, or otherwise inspired by, recipes from the following sources:

- [The How Not to Die Cookbook](https://nutritionfacts.org/cookbook/)
- [The Doctor's Kitchen](https://thedoctorskitchen.com/my-book)

Additional nutritional information was retrieved from:

- [How Not to Die](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/)

Many recipes are simply my preferential alterations on recipes mentioned in these books. I can vouch for each recipe I've included, since I wanted to write them up in a more digestable form that I could continually refer back to. They're tasty, relatively easy to make, but most importantly they are _simple_.
