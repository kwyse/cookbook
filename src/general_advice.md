# General Advice

- Try to eat legumes with every meal.
- When shopping for whole grains, try to minimise the ratio of carbohydrates to dietary fibre. The Five-to-One rule states that, per 100g, there should not be more than five times as many carbohydrates as there is fibre, though this is difficult to achieve in practice. Whole grains that achieve less than a ten-to-one ratio, whilst not as good, are still worth purchasing.
